/*
M1. Network formation. [5p]. Your nodes must be able to form networks as described in the Kadem-
	lia paper.8 Kademlia is a protocol for facilitating Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs).9 Concretely,
	the following aspects of the algorithm must be implemented:
	(a) Pinging. This means that you must implement and use the PING message.
	(b) Network joining. Given the IP address, and any other data you decide, of any single
		node, a node must be able to join or form a network with that node.
	(c) Node lookup. When part of a network, each node must be able to retrieve the contact
	information of any other node in the same network.
